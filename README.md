# 🎬 Movie Data Analysis using Python

## Project Overview

This project performs **data analysis on a movie dataset** using Python libraries like **Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, and Seaborn**.
The dataset contains information about movies such as budget, revenue, genres, language, cast, and crew.


---

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

* Python 
* Pandas
* NumPy
* Matplotlib
* Seaborn
* Google Colab

---

## 📂 Dataset

* Dataset used: `imdb_data.csv`
* Contains ~3000 movie records

---

## ⚙️ Data Preprocessing

* Removed movies with zero budget
* Created new columns:

  * **Profit = Revenue - Budget**
  * **ROI = Profit / Budget**
* Extracted:

  * Director from `crew`
  * Producer from `crew`
  * Actors from `cast`

---

## 📊 Analysis & Results

### ✅ Q1. Highest Profit Movie

* Identified the movie with maximum profit
* Extracted its **director, producer, and actors**

---

### ✅ Q2. Language with Highest ROI

* Calculated average ROI for each language
* Found top-performing language

---

### ✅ Q3. Unique Genres

* Extracted all unique genres from dataset
* Observed diversity in movie categories

---

### ✅ Q4. Top Producers

* Created table of producers and directors
* Found **Top 3 producers** with highest average ROI

---

### ✅ Q5. Most Frequent Actor

* Identified actor appearing in most movies
* Analyzed:

  * Their movies
  * Genres
  * Profit trends

---

### ✅ Q6. Directors & Preferred Actors

* Selected top 3 directors
* Found actors they collaborate with most

## 📈 Visualizations

The project includes multiple visualizations:

* 📊 Bar Charts (ROI, Top Movies, Producers)
* 🥧 Pie Chart (Language Distribution)
* 📉 Histogram (Profit Distribution)
* 🔵 Scatter Plot (Budget vs Revenue, ROI vs Profit)
* 🔥 Heatmap (Correlation Analysis)

---

## 📌 Key Insights

* Higher budget does not always guarantee higher profit
* Certain languages generate better ROI
* Strong collaboration exists between specific actors and directors
* Revenue has a strong correlation with profit
